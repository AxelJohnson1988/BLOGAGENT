            "But to her astonishment, it sprouted. Not with delicate leaves, but with thick, velvety stalks that unfurled into broad, dark-green foliage. It grew with an almost alarming speed, reaching knee-high within a week. Then, a single bud appeared at the top, a perfect sphere of deep violet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Days later, as the first stars began to prick the evening sky, the bud slowly unfurled. It wasn't a flower of petals, but a delicate, bell-shaped bloom, pulsating with a soft, ethereal light. And then, it hummed. A low, resonant note that vibrated through the cottage, filling the air with a soothing, melodic drone. It was a sound that chased away the silence, the loneliness, and the dust that had accumulated in the corners of Elara's life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Neighbors, drawn by the strange, beautiful hum and the soft glow, began to visit. They sat in her garden, listening, feeling a peace they hadn't known was missing. Elara, who had spent decades in quiet solitude, found herself smiling, sharing tea, and talking about the wonders of the humming bloom.\n",
            "\n",
            "The flower continued to hum, a gentle symphony through the seasons, a silent promise that even in the most neglected spaces, something extraordinary can take root, bringing light and music to the world. And Elara, for the first time, felt truly alive, nurturing not just a plant, but the quiet magic it had brought into her home."

            "1.  **`body` (Global Page Styles)**\n",
            "    *   **`font-family: sans-serif;`**: Sets a common, easy-to-read sans-serif font for all text on the page.\n",
            "    *   **`line-height: 1.6;`**: Improves readability by providing ample spacing between lines of text.\n",
            "    *   **`margin: 0; padding: 0;`**: Resets the default browser margins and padding, ensuring consistent spacing across different browsers and providing a clean slate for layout.\n",
            "    *   **`background-color: #f4f4f4;`**: Applies a light gray background to the entire page, which is softer on the eyes than pure white.\n",
            "    *   **`color: #333;`**: Sets a dark gray color for the default text, offering good contrast against the light background.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **`header` (Page Header)**\n",
            "    *   **`background: #333;`**: Gives the header a solid dark gray background.\n",
            "    *   **`color: #fff;`**: Sets the text color inside the header to white, creating a strong contrast with the dark background.\n",
            "    *   **`padding: 1rem 0;`**: Adds vertical padding (1 unit relative to font size) above and below the header content, with no horizontal padding.\n",
            "    *   **`text-align: center;`**: Centers the content (like the `h1`) within the header.\n",
            "    *   **`header h1 { margin: 0; }`**: Removes the default top/bottom margin from the main heading within the header, allowing it to sit cleanly within the header's padding.\n",

            "3.  **`main` (Main Content Area)**\n",
            "    *   **`padding: 1rem 20px;`**: Provides internal spacing around the main content, separating it from the edges of the browser window and ensuring content isn't flush against the sides.\n",

            "4.  **`section` (Content Blocks)**\n",

            "    *   **`padding: 1rem;`**: Adds internal spacing around the content within each section.\n",
            "    *   **`margin-bottom: 1rem;`**: Creates vertical space between different sections, separating them visually.\n",
            "    *   **`border-radius: 5px;`**: Applies slightly rounded corners to each section, giving them a softer, modern \"card-like\" appearance.\n",

            "5.  **`h2` (Secondary Headings)**\n",

            "6.  **`table` (Tables)**\n",
            "    *   **`width: 100%;`**: Makes the table expand to fill the full width of its parent container.\n",
            "    *   **`border-collapse: collapse;`**: Merges adjacent table cell borders into a single, clean border line, preventing double borders.\n",
            "    *   **`margin-top: 1rem;`**: Adds space above the table, separating it from preceding content.\n",

            "    *   **`border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;`**: Adds a subtle light gray border at the bottom of each cell, visually separating rows.\n",

            "9.  **`footer` (Page Footer)**\n",

            "    *   **`padding: 1rem 0;`**: Adds vertical padding, similar to the header.\n",
            "    *   **`background: #333;`**: Sets a dark gray background.\n",
            "    *   **`color: #fff;`**: Sets white text color for contrast.\n",
            "    *   **`position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;`**: These three properties together create a \"sticky\" footer. It takes the footer out of the normal document flow (`fixed`), positions it at the very bottom of the viewport (`bottom: 0`), and ensures it spans the full width of the screen (`width: 100%`) regardless of scroll position.\n",
