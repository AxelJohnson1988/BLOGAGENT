        "The traceback shows a `ValueError` during the second `train_test_split` call (splitting `X_temp`, `y_temp` into validation and test sets). The error states that the least populated class in `y_temp` has only 1 member, and stratified splitting requires at least 2 members per class. This is due to the small size and potentially uneven distribution of classes in the `X_temp`/`y_temp` temporary set created by the first split. To resolve this and allow the stratified split to proceed for demonstration purposes, I will add more dummy data for the 'unknown' category to ensure that `y_temp` has at least two samples for the 'unknown' class after the first split. I will add two more 'unknown' entries and then rerun the splitting and subsequent steps.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Key Performance Metrics for Monitoring:\n",
            "- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of predictions.\n",
            "- **Precision, Recall, F1-score (per class):** Important for understanding performance on individual artifact categories, especially for imbalanced datasets.\n",
            "- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications across all classes.\n",
            "- **Prediction Confidence/Probability:** Monitor the distribution of model confidence scores (e.g., using `predict_proba`). Low confidence might indicate ambiguous cases or drift.\n",
            "- **Latency:** Time taken for the model to make a prediction (operational metric).\n",
            "- **Error Rate:** Monitor the rate of prediction errors or exceptions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Metric Collection Methods:\n",
            "- **Logging:** Log the input features, predicted category, prediction confidence, and the timestamp for every prediction made in the production environment.\n",
            "- **Ground Truth Collection:** When possible, collect the actual 'ground truth' artifact category after the prediction has been made (e.g., if a user manually corrects a classification, or if the artifact is later processed in a way that reveals its true nature).\n",
            "- **Periodic Review:** Periodically (e.g., weekly, monthly), sample predictions from the logs and have human experts review and label a subset to obtain ground truth for evaluation.\n",
            "- **Automated Comparison:** If ground truth is collected automatically, compare the logged predictions against the ground truth to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, etc.\n",
            "- **Input Data Logging:** Log key characteristics of the input data (e.g., distribution of categorical features, range/distribution of numerical features, presence of 'unknown' or new values in categorical features).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Performance Degradation Detection Strategy:\n",
            "- **Establish Baseline Metrics:** Record the performance metrics (Accuracy, F1-scores, etc.) of the deployed model on a representative test set during the initial evaluation phase. This is the baseline.\n",
            "- **Calculate Current Metrics:** Periodically (using collected ground truth or reviewed samples) calculate the current performance metrics in production.\n",
            "- **Compare Current vs. Baseline:** Compare the current production metrics to the established baseline. Significant drops (e.g., >X% drop in accuracy or average F1-score) trigger an alert or investigation.\n",
            "- **Monitor Input Data Drift:** Compare the distribution of incoming production data features (e.g., agent, action, file extension distributions, file size distribution) to the distribution of the training data. Significant shifts might indicate data drift, which can lead to performance degradation.\n",
            "- **Monitor Prediction Distribution:** Track the distribution of predicted categories. Sudden changes (e.g., a category that was common is now rarely predicted) might signal issues.\n",
            "- **Monitor Confidence Scores:** A drop in average prediction confidence or an increase in low-confidence predictions can indicate the model is encountering data it's less certain about.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Model Retraining Process and Triggers:\n",
            "- **Retraining Triggers:**\n",
            "  - **Performance Drop:** When performance degradation is detected based on the monitoring strategy.\n",
            "  - **New Labeled Data:** When a significant amount of new, labeled data becomes available (e.g., from periodic reviews or system updates).\n",
            "  - **Scheduled Intervals:** Periodically retrain the model (e.g., every 3 or 6 months) regardless of performance or new data volume, as a proactive measure.\n",
            "  - **Significant System Changes:** If there are major changes to the artifact registration process, agents, actions, or file types.\n",
            "- **Retraining Process Definition:** Define an automated or semi-automated pipeline for retraining.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Steps Involved in Retraining:\n",
            "a. **Data Collection:** Gather all available historical data, including the original training data and any new labeled data collected since the last training cycle.\n",
            "b. **Data Preparation:** Run the entire data preparation pipeline on the new, larger dataset:\n",
            "   - Collect features from manifest and file system (including the `file_missing` check).\n",
            "   - Clean the data (handle missing values, standardize text).\n",
            "   - Apply transformations (extract extension, re-fit/re-apply one-hot encoding on the expanded set of categories, re-fit/re-apply scaling on the updated numerical data). It's crucial to use the *same* pipeline steps but fit the encoders/scalers on the new, comprehensive training data.\n",
            "c. **Data Splitting:** Split the newly prepared dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (stratified if the target is imbalanced).\n",
            "d. **Model Training:** Train the chosen ML model(s) on the new training data.\n",
            "e. **Model Evaluation & Selection:** Evaluate the retrained model(s) on the new validation set. Compare performance to the previous model's baseline and potentially other models. Select the best performing model.\n",
            "f. **Testing:** Evaluate the selected model on the new, unseen test set to get a final performance estimate.\n",
            "g. **Serialization:** Serialize the retrained model and the *newly fitted* preprocessor.\n",
            "h. **Versioning:** Assign a new version identifier to the retrained model and preprocessor artifacts.\n",
            "i. **Deployment:** Deploy the new model and preprocessor artifacts to the production environment.\n",
            "j. **Update Baseline:** Update the performance baseline with the metrics of the newly deployed model on its test set.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Infrastructure Maintenance and Versioning:\n",
            "- **Artifact Versioning:** Every time a model or preprocessor is retrained and saved, assign it a new version number (e.g., using semantic versioning or timestamps). Store these versions in a dedicated artifact repository or versioned storage location.\n",
            "- **Code Versioning:** The code for the data preparation pipeline, model training script, evaluation script, and the system component that loads/uses the model should be managed under version control (e.g., Git). Link specific model/preprocessor versions to the code versions that trained/use them.\n",
            "- **Dependency Management:** Use a `requirements.txt` or similar file to specify the exact versions of Python libraries (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `joblib`, etc.) that the model training and deployment environments depend on. Keep this file updated and versioned.\n",
            "- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** If deploying to cloud environments or containers, use IaC tools (like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) to define and manage the deployment environment consistently across versions.\n",
            "- **Monitoring Infrastructure:** Ensure the logging and monitoring systems collecting model performance and data drift metrics are reliable and maintained.\n",
            "- **Backup Strategy:** Implement backups for the saved model/preprocessor artifacts and the manifest/data storage.\n",
            "- **Security:** Secure access to the model artifacts and the environment where they run.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Strategies for Handling Concept Drift or Data Drift:\n",
            "- **Monitoring (as described above):** This is the first line of defense. Detect drift by monitoring input data characteristics and model performance.\n",
            "- **Retraining (as described above):** Regular retraining on the most recent data is the primary mitigation strategy for both data and concept drift.\n",
            "- **Adaptive Learning:** For some problems, consider online learning or incremental learning techniques where the model updates continuously or in small batches as new data arrives, rather than full retraining from scratch.\n",
            "- **Ensemble Methods:** Use ensemble methods (like training models on different time periods of data or using weighted ensembles) that can be more robust to drift.\n",
            "- **Feature Store:** Implement a feature store to ensure consistency in how features are defined, calculated, and served for both training and inference, reducing sources of data inconsistency.\n",
            "- **Data Validation:** Add data validation steps in the prediction pipeline to check if incoming data conforms to the expected format, range, and distribution based on the training data.\n",
            "- **Expert Review:** Maintain a feedback loop where domain experts can review predictions and highlight cases where the model is clearly wrong, which can be symptoms of drift.\n"

        "\n",
        "*   The goal for ML integration was defined as automatically classifying registered artifacts based on characteristics like filename, extension, and potentially content.\n",
        "*   Key data requirements include filename, provenance details (agent, action, plan\\_id, node\\_id), file size, and file extension, sourced primarily from the MANIFEST.json and the file system.\n",
        "*   A critical challenge identified in data preparation was the need for labeled data (artifact categories) and handling potential issues with missing files and data imbalance.\n",
        "*   The chosen ML approaches for the classification task were Random Forest, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression, suitable for handling mixed data types.\n",
        "*   Training the models required resolving issues with stratified data splitting on a small, imbalanced dataset by adding more dummy data for less represented classes.\n",
        "*   The integration strategy focuses on classifying artifacts during the registration process or on demand, requiring the saved preprocessor and trained model to be available in the system component.\n",
        "*   Deployment involves serializing and saving the trained model and fitted preprocessor using libraries like `joblib` and ensuring necessary Python dependencies are available in the deployment environment.\n",
        "*   A comprehensive plan for monitoring includes tracking metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and detecting performance degradation by comparing current metrics to a baseline and monitoring data/concept drift.\n",
        "*   Retraining is triggered by performance drops, new labeled data, scheduled intervals, or system changes, following a defined pipeline that includes collecting new data, reapplying the updated preprocessing, and re-evaluating the model.\n",
        "*   Maintenance and versioning involve versioning model artifacts, code, dependencies, and potentially using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Develop a robust data labeling process or tool to acquire sufficient and high-quality ground truth data, as this is a critical prerequisite for training a reliable supervised classification model.\n",
        "*   Implement the outlined monitoring system to track model performance and potential data/concept drift in production, establishing clear triggers for retraining and maintenance.\n",

            "    - Pros: Frontend receives original, readable names directly; Naming System logic is kept server-side.\n",
            "    - Cons: Backend processing time increases, especially if many names need expansion; requires the Backend to have access to the Naming System.\n",
            "2.  **Frontend Expansion:** The Frontend component receives compressed names from the Backend and calls the Naming System's `expand` function client-side.\n",
            "    - Pros: Reduces backend load; might be faster if the Naming System can be exposed client-side.\n",
            "    - Cons: Requires the Naming System (or its expansion logic and mappings) to be available in the frontend (less common/secure); adds complexity to the frontend.\n",
            "3.  **Hybrid Approach:** Backend sends both compressed and original (or partially expanded) names. Frontend uses original for display but has an option to show/request full expansion.\n",

            "Implementation Steps for Handling Compressed Names (assuming Backend Expansion):\n",
            "1.  **Core stores compressed names:** Ensure the Core's `register_artifact` saves compressed names (by calling the Naming System's `compress` function) into the manifest entry for relevant fields (e.g., filename, agent, etc.).\n",
            "2.  **Backend Access to Naming System:** The Timeline Backend component needs to instantiate or access the Naming System instance.\n",
            "3.  **Backend Expansion Logic:** Modify the Backend data processing steps (Step 4, point 5) to iterate through the retrieved manifest entries.\n",
            "    - For each entry, identify fields containing compressed names.\n",
            "    - Call `naming_system.expand()` for each compressed name.\n",
            "    - Replace the compressed name with the expanded original identifier in the data sent to the frontend.\n",
            "    - Handle potential errors during expansion (e.g., mapping not found, checksum mismatch), perhaps displaying a placeholder like '[Expansion Error]'.\n",
            "4.  **Frontend Display:** In the Frontend, display the received (now expanded) names as part of the event details.\n",
            "5.  **Optional: Display Compressed:** The Backend could send both the original and compressed names, allowing the Frontend to display the compressed name alongside the expanded one, perhaps as a tooltip or in a details view.\n",

            "1. Handling and Storage of Probability Outputs:\n",
            "For classification models that support it (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), the `predict_proba()` method provides the probability distribution over all possible classes for a given input.\n",
            "Instead of just storing the single highest-probability class (the predicted label), it is valuable to store the full probability vector or a representation of it.\n",
            "- **Storage Location:**\n",
            "  - The probability distribution can be stored alongside the predicted category in the artifact's entry in the **MANIFEST.json** (if using a database, this would be a dedicated column or a JSON/text field storing the probabilities).\n",
            "  - For a JSON manifest, this could be a dictionary like `{'predicted_category': 'report', 'probabilities': {'report': 0.85, 'log': 0.10, 'configuration': 0.05}}`.\n",
            "- **Value of Probabilities:**\n",
            "  - **Confidence:** High probabilities for the predicted class indicate high confidence in the prediction.\n",
            "  - **Ambiguity:** Low probabilities for the predicted class, or relatively high probabilities for multiple classes, indicate ambiguity or uncertainty.\n",
            "  - **Thresholding:** Probabilities allow for applying custom thresholds (e.g., only accept a prediction if the probability is > 0.9).\n",
            "  - **Further Analysis:** Probabilities can be used for downstream analysis or ranking artifacts by certainty.\n",
            "\n",

            "- **ExploreGPT Timeline:**\n",
            "  - **Visualization:** Display prediction confidence on the timeline (e.g., using color intensity, marker size, or tooltips). Artifacts with low confidence could be visually highlighted.\n",
            "  - **Filtering:** Allow users to filter timeline events based on prediction confidence (e.g., show only predictions with confidence > 0.7).\n",
            "  - **Details View:** Display the full probability distribution in the detailed view when a timeline event is selected.\n",
            "- **Core (for Downstream Processing):**\n",
            "  - The Core, when orchestrating other processes, can use the stored probabilities.\n",

            "  - **Provenance Analysis:** Analyze common patterns in agent-action-plan-node sequences.\n",
            "  - **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual artifacts or events (e.g., unusually large files, unexpected file types for a given agent/plan, sudden spikes in registration volume).\n",

            "- **Technical Implementation:**\n",
            "  - **Dedicated Analysis Module/Service:** Create a separate module or service responsible for performing these analyses.\n",
            "  - **Data Source:** This component will primarily pull data from the Core's manifest (and potentially access file system metadata if needed for deeper analysis).\n",
            "  - **Libraries:** Utilize data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn.\n",

            "1. Primary Data Flows between Core, Naming System, and Timeline:\n",
            "- **Core -> Naming System:** The Core provides raw identifiers (filenames, agent names, plan_ids, node_ids, etc.) to the Naming System for compression during artifact registration.\n",
            "- **Naming System -> Core:** The Naming System returns compressed names back to the Core for storage in the manifest.\n",
            "- **Core -> Timeline:** The Core provides artifact manifest entries (including timestamps, SHA256 hashes, filenames, provenance details, and potentially compressed names and ML predictions/probabilities) to the Timeline for visualization and analysis.\n",
            "- **Timeline (Frontend) -> Timeline (Backend):** The Frontend sends requests for artifact data (filtered by time range, etc.) to the Backend.\n",
            "- **Timeline (Backend) -> Timeline (Frontend):** The Backend returns requested artifact data (potentially with expanded names) to the Frontend.\n",
            "- **Timeline (Backend) -> Naming System:** If backend expansion is used, the Timeline Backend sends compressed names to the Naming System for expansion.\n",

            "- **Core -> ML Integration (for Training Data Collection):** For training, the ML data preparation pipeline accesses historical artifact data from the Core's manifest and potentially retrieves file system metadata (size, etc.) based on file paths provided by the manifest.\n",
            "- **Core -> ML Integration (for Inference Input):** For inference (e.g., during registration), the Core (or a component it orchestrates) collects raw/derived features for a single new artifact (manifest details, file size, extension) and provides them to the ML prediction function.\n",
            "- **ML Integration -> Core:** The ML prediction function sends its output (predicted artifact category and associated probabilities) back to the Core.\n",

If so, the ML data pipeline would get compressed names from the manifest (provided by the Core) and potentially need to interact with the Naming System for lookup if the encoding isn't directly usable as a feature.\n",
            "  - **No Direct Dependency:** The core ML classification task (based on provenance, filename, size, extension) does not *require* the Naming System to function, although the Naming System operates on some of the same underlying data (provenance strings, filenames).\n",
